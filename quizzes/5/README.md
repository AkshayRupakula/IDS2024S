1. Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual elements that are used to encode data and represent it graphically. These elements make it easier to perceive patterns, trends, and outliers within the data. Examples:
* Color - Used to distinguish groups, highlight specific data, or represent values (e.g., heatmaps).
* Size - Points, bars, or lines can vary in size to represent different values or categories.

2. The two major classes of aesthetics are:
* Geometric Aesthetics - These involve the basic geometric properties used to represent data visually, such as position, size, and shape.
* Visual Aesthetics - These involve properties that enhance the visual appeal and clarity of the data representation, such as color, texture, and orientation.

3.
* Factors: These are the independent variables in an experiment that are manipulated to observe their effect on some outcome. Factors are the variables that the experimenter chooses to change to see how their variations affect the response. For example, in an agricultural experiment, common factors might include types of fertilizer, irrigation methods, or crop varieties.
* Levels: These are the different states or settings of each factor in the experiment. Each factor can have two or more levels. For instance, if "temperature" is a factor in an experiment, its levels might be 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. The levels are the specific values that a factor can take.

4. The two major types of Data are:
* Quantitative Data: This type of data is numerical and can be measured. Example: Temperature in any scale, population size, or a person's weight.
* Qualitative Data: This type of data describes qualities or characteristics. Example: Colors of cars, types of food, or ethnicities.

5. Categorical Variables/ Observations.

6. Examples of Ordered and Unordered data are:
* Unordered: Nationalities, Bloodtypes, Marital status, etc
* Ordered: Socioeconomic Status, sizes, numbers, days, etc

7. Polar coordinate systems are particularly effective for datasets where the data points are naturally circular or angular. These include:
* Directional Data: When measuring wind directions, orientations, or any phenomenon that has an angular component.
* Periodic Functions: Data that exhibits periodicity, such as time series data of daily temperatures or seasonal variations, can be clearly represented in polar coordinates to highlight the cyclic nature.
* Radial Measurements: Examples include radar charts used in performance evaluations where attributes are rated on a scale from the center outward.
* Circular Relations: Such as phase plots in physics or when examining relationships in data that naturally wrap around a circle.

8. The four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage are: 
* Sequential Color Scales: Best used for displaying data that has ordering from low to high. This scale helps in visualizing data that progresses through a range, such as temperature, elevation, or any quantitative measurement.
* Diverging Color Scales: Ideal for data that deviates around a median value or has a critical midpoint, such as zero. These scales highlight variation both above and below the median or midpoint.
* Qualitative Color Scales: Used when there’s no inherent ordering or numeric progression in the data, such as categorical data. This scale uses distinctly different colors to represent different categories for clarity and differentiation.
* Heatmap Color Scales: Often used in matrices or grid visualizations where data density or intensity needs to be shown. These scales typically use a single hue that transitions from light (low) to dark (high) to represent density or intensity.

9. Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations beacuse 3D perspective makes a plot difficult to read.

10. A dataset of temperatures can be considered numerical (Quantitative) and on the other hand a dataset containing Locations of places in world can be considered categorical

11. Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetics?

12. From the three coordinates, all are valid and can be used to represent data. Althought it would be easy to understand data on the second graph.

13. From the following color palettes the first more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans but the second one can be used for those individual suffereing from a certain kind of colorblindness

14.
* Which city’s temperature is the least varying throughout the year? San Diego
* Which city’s temperature is the wildest varying throughout the year? Death Valley
* Which city the hottest in the month of January? San Diego
* Which city the coolest in the month of July? Answer: San Diego

15.
* a. Color to distinguish categories
* b. Color to represent data values (sequential)
* c. Color to represent data values (diverging)
* d. Color as a tool to highlight

16. Color scale as a tool to highlight was used, the states highlighted are Texas and Louisiana.

17. A horizontal plot can be used instead. The plot should be in decending order and the axis need to be flipped. OR the axis can remain the same but there must be enough spacing between each plot

19. Just by looking a this graph it is clear that the temperature of Earth will increase in the long run but with fluctuations in the following decades?
    The Earth will be hotter by 2 degrees celcius in 2050 with respect to the average temperature during 1951-1980.
