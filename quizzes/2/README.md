1. Cpu registers

2. The rapid technological progress in the development of smaller transistors led to the design of CPUs that became increasingly faster than the typical memory access speed of the time. This led to the crteation of the heirarchy of memory. In this hierarchy, as we move to the tip of the pyramid, closer to the processor, the memory access speed increases. However, the memory size also shrinks. There is, therefore, a compromise between memory access speed and memory size. The benefit of this hierarchical memory layout is that the CPU can predict and prefetch the future data or instructions from the slower but larger levels of memory hierarchy to the higher levels for subsequent usage by the CPU for computations.

3. The slowest storage device typically integrated with computers is the Hard Disk Drive (HDD).

4. Registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM, Disk

5. The smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is the bit.

6.  Computers operate on a binary system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1. In a computer microchip, transistors act as switches, letting current through to represent the binary digit 1, or 0 when the switch is off. Hence that is why humans chose binary data to represent information in computers

7. Less than a nano second
8. 1822 so 1800s
9. 1900s
10. They can only perform the algorithms for which they had been physically wired and built into.
11. ENIAC is an example for fixed programming
12. Declrative means stating facts or opinions while imperative means giving commands or requests to a machine or human
13. a,b - declarative, c,d,e - imperative
14. Genetic algorithms
15. Name of the first digital computer is eniac

16. Python but Pearl was popular before python.
17. Plasma Scientific computing language
18. CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, Power unit, Fans, Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor
19. Source code
20. * 1950s: FORTRAN (1954), COBOL (1959)
    * 1960s: B (1969)
    * 1980s: C++ (1983), Python (1989)
    * 1990s: Java (1995)
22. a. The closest programming language to machine code is Assembly language.  
    b. Assembly language needs to be translated into machine code to be executed by the computer, but this process is not usually referred to as "interpretation." Instead, it is          assembled or compiled by an assembler. The assembler converts assembly language instructions into equivalent machine code so that the CPU they comprehend and execute it.
23. a. The oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use is FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation).
    b. FORTRAN was created in 1957, which makes it approximately 7 decades old.
24. a. A second-generation programming language refers to Assembly language.
    b. The language-generation classification for the mentioned languages is as follows:
      * FORTRAN: First-generation high-level programming language.
      * C: Third-generation programming language (3GL).
      * C++: Third-generation programming language (3GL), with object-oriented programming capabilities.
      * MATLAB: Fourth-generation programming language (4GL), focused on numerical computing.
      * Python: Third-generation programming language (3GL), used for its readability and support for multiple programming paradigms.
      * R: Third-generation programming language (3GL), used for statistical computing and graphics.
25. * C: Created in the 1970s, specifically around 1972.
    * C++: Created in the 1980s, its first commercial implementation was available around 1985.
    * MATLAB: Released in the 1980s, specifically 1984.
    * Python: Created in the late 1980s and officially released to the public in 1991
26. An ancestor programming language of C is B.
27. An ancestor programming language of C++ is C.
28. MATHLAB = ForTran and Python = ABC Programming language
29. The quantity of power to which a base must be raised to inorder for it to be a certain value
