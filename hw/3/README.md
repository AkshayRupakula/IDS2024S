* Finanace: Data Science is applied to analyze market trends, manage risks, and automate trading strategies. Big data analytics and machine learning models can predict stock market movements, evaluate investment risks, and optimize portfolios.  
* Economics: Computational models help in analyzing economic policies, forecasting economic conditions, and understanding complex economic systems through the analysis of vast amounts of financial data.  
* Healthcare: Computational and data sciences are used for predicting disease outbreaks, personalizing medical treatments, and improving diagnostic accuracy.  

3. 
* Inductive Reasoning: Involves making generalizations based on observing specific instances.  
Example: Every cat I have seen has four legs. My friend's cat has four legs. The cat in the book also has four legs. Therefore, all cats have four legs. This conclusion is probable, except that there might exist a cat that does not fit this generalization due to mutation or injury.  

* Deductive Reasoning: Involves starting with a hypothesis and examining the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion.  
Example: All birds have feathers. A penguin is a bird. Therefore, a penguin has feathers. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It provides a conclusive proof, assuming the premises are accurate.
