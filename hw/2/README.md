2. **ENIAC=** Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer  
3. Everything is represented by integers in computers because computers use binary (base-2) number system, where all data is encoded using only two states: **0 and 1**. Integers are easily represented and manipulated in binary, making them a fundamental building block for encoding more complex data types and instructions efficiently.  
4. The fastest part of computer memory is the **Cache Memory**.  
5. The slowest storage device typically integrated with computers is the Hard **Disk Drive (HDD)**.
6. The smallest unit of information in computer science is the **bit**.
7. a. The closest programming language to machine code is **Assembly language**.  
   b. Assembly language needs to be translated into machine code to be executed by the computer, but this process is not usually referred to as "interpretation." Instead, it is assembled or compiled by an assembler. The assembler converts assembly language instructions into equivalent machine code so that the CPU they comprehend and execute it.  
8. a. The oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use is **FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation)**.  
   b. **FORTRAN** was created in 1957, which makes it approximately 7 decades old.
9. a.  A second-generation programming language refers to **Assembly language**.
